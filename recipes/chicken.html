    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>skinlees, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
      <li>Buffalo wing sauce</li>
      <li>refrigerated pizza dough</li>
      <li>vegetable oil, divided</li>
      <li>shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 410 degrees F (210 degrees C). Grease a 12-inch
        pizza pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place chicken into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a
        boil. Cook chicken in boiling water until no longer pink in the center
        and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer
        inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees
        C). Transfer chicken to a bowl and shred with two forks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir shredded
        chicken and Buffalo wing sauce in hot butter until chicken is coated and
        heated through, 2 to 4 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn pizza dough out onto a generously floured surface. Roll dough into
        a 12-inch round. Brush dough with 1 tablespoon oil and sprinkle with 1
        cup mozzarella cheese, leaving a 1-inch border. Spread chicken mixture
        over cheese; top with remaining 1 cup cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fold pizza dough in half and pinch edges together to seal. Transfer
        calzone to the prepared pan and brush the top with remaining 1
        tablespoon oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown, 17 to 20
        minutes.
      </li>
    </ul>
